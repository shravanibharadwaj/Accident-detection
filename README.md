# Accident-detection

Developed an accident and fire detection system using YOLO deep learning model for real-time hazard recognition. Trained the model on annotated datasets to accurately detect fire and vehicular accidents from surveillance footage. Implemented the system with OpenCV and TensorFlow for fast inference and alert generation. Enhanced detection accuracy through data augmentation and fine-tuning techniques.
